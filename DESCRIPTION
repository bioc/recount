Description: Explore and download data from the recount project available at
    https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/. Using the recount package you can
    download RangedSummarizedExperiment objects at the gene, exon or exon-exon junctions level,
    the raw counts, the phenotype metadata used, the urls to the sample coverage
    bigWig files or the mean coverage bigWig file for a particular study. The
    RangedSummarizedExperiment objects can be used by different packages for
    performing differential expression analysis. Using
    http://bioconductor.org/packages/derfinder you can perform
    annotation-agnostic differential expression analyses with the data from the
    recount project as described at http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/08/068478.
