\title{Explore and download data from the recount project.}
\description{
Explore and download data from the recount project available at
\url{https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/}. Using the recount package 
you can download 
\link[SummarizedExperiment]{RangedSummarizedExperiment-class}
objects at the gene or exon level, the raw counts, the phenotype metadata 
used, the urls to the sample coverage bigWig files or the mean coverage 
bigWig file for a particular study. The 
\link[SummarizedExperiment]{RangedSummarizedExperiment-class} objects can be 
used by different packages for performing differential expression analysis. 
Using \url{http://bioconductor.org/packages/derfinder} you can perform
annotation-agnostic differential expression analyses with the data from the 
recount project.
