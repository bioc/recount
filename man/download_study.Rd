\title{Download data for a given SRA study id from the recount project}
\usage{
download_study(project, type = "rse-gene", outdir = project,
  download = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{project}{A character vector with one SRA study id.}

\item{type}{Specifies which files to download. The options are:
\describe{
    \item{rse-gene}{ the gene-level 
    \link[SummarizedExperiment]{RangedSummarizedExperiment-class} object in 
    a file named rse_gene.Rdata.}
    \item{rse-exon}{ the exon-level 
    \link[SummarizedExperiment]{RangedSummarizedExperiment-class} object in 
    a file named rse_exon.Rdata.}
    \item{rse-jx}{ the exon-exon junction level 
    \link[SummarizedExperiment]{RangedSummarizedExperiment-class} object in 
    a file named rse_jx.Rdata.}
    \item{counts-gene}{ the gene-level counts in a tsv file named
    counts_gene.tsv.gz.}
    \item{counts-exon}{ the exon-level counts in a tsv file named
    counts_exon.tsv.gz.}
    \item{counts-jx}{ the exon-exon junction level counts in a tsv file named
    counts_jx.tsv.gz.}
    \item{phenotype}{ the phenotype data for the study in a tsv file named
    \code{project}.tsv.}
    \item{files-info}{ the files information for the given study (including
    md5sum hashes) in a tsv file named files_info.tsv.}
    \item{samples}{ one bigWig file per sample in the study.}
    \item{mean}{ one mean bigWig file for the samples in the study, 
    with each sample normalized to a 40 million 100 bp library using the
    total coverage sum (area under the coverage curve, AUC) for the given 
    sample.}
    \item{all}{ Downloads all the above types. Note that it might take some
    time if the project has many samples. When using \code{type = 'all'} a
    small delay will be added before each download request to avoid
    request issues.}
}}

\item{outdir}{The destination directory for the downloaded file(s).
Alternatively check the \code{SciServer} section on the vignette to see
how to access all the recount data via a R Jupyter Notebook.}

\item{download}{Whether to download the files or just get the download urls.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \link[downloader]{download}.}
}
\value{
Returns invisibly the URL(s) for the files that were downloaded.
}
\description{
Download the gene or exon level 
\link[SummarizedExperiment]{RangedSummarizedExperiment-class} objects 
provided by the recount project. Alternatively download the counts, metadata 
or file information for a given SRA study id. You can also download the 
sample bigWig files or the mean coverage bigWig file.

the effective URLs. For example,
\url{http://duffel.rail.bio/recount/DRP000366/bw/mean_DRP000366.bw} points to
a temporary link from Amazon Cloud Drive.

## Download the example data included in the package for study SRP009615

url2 <- download_study('SRP009615')

## Load the data
load(file.path('SRP009615', 'rse_gene.Rdata'))

## Compare the data
library('testthat')
